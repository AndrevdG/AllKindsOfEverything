# Introduction

This folder contains several documentation files / snippets. These serve just as a reminder of things I have done before and I want to prevent having to reinvent the wheel. Somethings may be usable for other people. other things may not be complete or do not make sense.

This is public to allow linking to documentation files from other sources and you are free to browse/ use what you can. No usability is implied and anything you may use comes without any guarantee and is to be used solely at your own risk.
